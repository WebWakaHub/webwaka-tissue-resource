# ResourceTissue — Specification Document
## Tissue ID: TIS-RESOURCE-v0.1.0
## Classification: Scale & Deployment

### 1. Purpose
Resource management tissue that coordinates resource allocation, pooling, and lifecycle across cells with offline-first resource caching for Nigeria-first bandwidth optimization.

### 2. Constitutional Constraints
- MUST be composed exclusively of Cells (no raw organelles)
- MUST NOT implement business-domain semantics
- MUST NOT implement UI components
- MUST NOT bypass Cell abstraction layer
- MAY span multiple categories as a cross-category assembly

### 3. Composed Cells
CEL-RESOURCEPOOL, CEL-RESOURCEALLOC, CEL-RESOURCEMON

### 4. Doctrine Compliance
| Doctrine | Enforcement |
|----------|-------------|
| Build Once Use Infinitely | Single tissue implementation reused across all deployment targets |
| Mobile First | All coordination APIs designed for mobile-constrained environments |
| PWA First | Service worker compatible event propagation |
| Offline First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) | Full offline operation with IndexedDB-backed coordination queue |
| Nigeria First | 30-second timeout defaults, 2G-aware payload sizes, en-NG locale |
| Africa First | Multi-region coordination with Lagos-primary failover |
| Vendor Neutral AI | No vendor lock-in for any AI coordination pathway |

### 5. Invariants
- Tissue coordination MUST be idempotent
- Cell composition MUST be declarative
- State transitions MUST be auditable
- Offline queue MUST preserve ordering guarantees
- Network-aware coordination MUST degrade gracefully on 2G/3G

### 6. Ratification
